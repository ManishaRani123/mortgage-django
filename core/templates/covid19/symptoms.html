                  <p >With rising COVID 19 cases in the country and changing weather, stigmas around coronavirus are also increasing. In such a scenario, UNICEF&nbsp;India using guidelines from WHO, MoHFW and AIIMS shared tips on how to treat medical symptoms at home and when to seek emergency medical help. However, the first and foremost thing that one should keep in mind is to isolate. The agency says, do not wait to get test results or get tested - self-isolate immediately on feeling any symptoms. Also, do not panic. One should remember that most people recover from COVID-19 and do not require hospitalization. However, it absolutely recommended to&nbsp;first speak to a doctor.</p>

<h2><strong>How to manage mild symptoms/ milder form of COVID-19 at home</strong></h2>

<ul>
    <li>Isolate yourself in a separate room with a working bathroom/toilet if possible.</li>
    <li>Wear triple sharing masks covering your nose and mouth whenever you open the door. Those entering your room should do the same. Also, discard the mask after eight hours.</li>
    <li>Make sure to wash your hands frequently with soap or use 70% alcohol-based sanitiser. You should also clean your room yourself with disinfectant or soap.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If possible open windows for better ventilation.</li>
    <li>Do not bathe with cold water. Use hot water if possible and tepid sponge.</li>
    <li>Utensils should be cleaned wearing cloves with soap and it is strongly advised to not use personal items with others.</li>
    <li>If you feel up for it, do a little exercise.</li>
    <li>Monitor your oxygen levels at least every six hours. If your breaths are too fast take a six minute walk and try again.</li>
    <li>Frequently check your temperature if you have fever.</li>
    <li>Keep yourself hydrated and have a healthy diet even if you can't taste a thing. There's no known food yet which can cure COVID but a healthy meal will ensure a faster recovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Seek emergency medical care in any of these cases</strong></h2>

<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Oxygen level on oximeter shows less than 94%</li>
    <li>shortness of breath worsens.</li>
    <li>lips or face turn blue-ish.</li>
    <li>feeling of disorientation increases</li>

    <li>unable to wake up or stay awake</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not self medicate, you can take paracetamol (500 mg) in four to six hours in case you have a high fever, but the dose shouldn't increase more than four in 24 hours.</p>
